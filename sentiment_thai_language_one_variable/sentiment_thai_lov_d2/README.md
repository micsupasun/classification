# Sentiment Thai language project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model for the Thai language, capable of classifying text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment categories. The model will be trained using a dataset of Thai text that has been pre-labeled with sentiment tags. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting the sentiment of unseen Thai text inputs, which can be used in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.

## Step
1. Data Collection:
2. Data Preprocessing:
3. Model Development:
4. Model Evaluation:
5. Deployment:

## Result
- The model demonstrated a strong ability to correctly classify positive and negative sentiments, with slightly lower performance on neutral sentiment classification.
- The model was deployed successfully and is capable of analyzing new Thai text inputs to predict their sentiment.
