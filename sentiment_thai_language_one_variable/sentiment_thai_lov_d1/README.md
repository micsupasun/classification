# Sentiment Thai language project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model specifically for Thai language text. The model aims to classify Thai text comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This analysis is crucial for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and social media content in the Thai language.

## Step
1. Data Preparation.
2. Data Exploration.
3. Text Processing.
4. Model Training.
5. Model Evaluation.
6. Model Deployment.

## Result
1. The model was trained and evaluated on the provided dataset, achieving satisfactory performance in classifying Thai comments into sentiment categories.
2. The final model was saved for deployment and can be integrated into applications that require sentiment analysis in the Thai language.
