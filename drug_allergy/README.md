# Drug Allergy project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict drug allergies using patient data. The aim is to identify whether a patient is likely to have an allergic reaction to a specific drug based on the available data, such as patient history, drug exposure, and other relevant clinical features.

## Step
1. Data Collection:
2. Data Preprocessing:
3. Model Selection:
4. Model Training and Evaluation:
5. Result Analysis:

## Result
The model demonstrated high recall on the training set, ensuring that potential allergic reactions were not missed. The use of mode imputation and KNN to handle missing data contributed to the model's performance. However, due to the small size of the validation set, further testing and cross-validation are recommended to confirm the model's robustness in real-world scenarios.
