1. [sentiment_thai_lov_d1](https://github.com/micsupasun/classification/tree/main/sentiment_thai_language_one_variable/sentiment_thai_lov_d1) is to build a sentiment analysis model specifically for Thai language text. The model aims to classify Thai text comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This analysis is crucial for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and social media content in the Thai language.
2. [sentiment_thai_lov_d2](https://github.com/micsupasun/classification/tree/main/sentiment_thai_language_one_variable/sentiment_thai_lov_d2) is to develop a sentiment analysis model for the Thai language, capable of classifying text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment categories. The model will be trained using a dataset of Thai text that has been pre-labeled with sentiment tags. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting the sentiment of unseen Thai text inputs, which can be used in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.
